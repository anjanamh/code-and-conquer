# Unhelpful voice assistant üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [code and conquer]


### Team Members
-  Member 1: [Adarsh ks] - [ICCS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT]
- Member 2: [Anjana mh] - [ICCS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT]


### Project Description
[This is an unhelpful voiceassistant which always gives sarcastic responses]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In today‚Äôs world, voice assistants are too helpful. They answer your questions instantly, set reminders, and never judge you for asking the time for the fifth time in an hour.
Clearly, this lack of sarcasm is an epidemic. People are becoming too dependent on polite AI instead of being roasted into self-reliance.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built Snarky Assistant ‚Äî a Flutter app that listens to your voice commands and replies with sass, attitude, and the occasional verbal eye-roll.
Ask it for the weather? It tells you to ‚Äúopen a window.‚Äù
Need the time? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time you got a watch.‚Äù
Want music? ‚ÄúYour voice is enough noise.‚Äù
It‚Äôs the perfect app for people who want an AI that treats them like their older sibling.]
